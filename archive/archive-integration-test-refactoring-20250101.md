## Challenges Encountered and Solutions

### Challenge 1: File Corruption During Large Edits
**Issue**: Several times during refactoring, files became corrupted or empty when using large edit operations
**Specific Files**: auth_sign_in_pom.dart, session_management_test.dart
**Solution Applied**: Incremental file replacement strategy (delete-and-recreate approach)
**Result**: Successfully avoided file corruption in later refactoring phases

### Challenge 2: Method Name Inconsistencies
**Issue**: Test files calling methods that didn't exist in refactored POMs
**Specific Examples**: `testInvalidEmailFormat()` vs `attemptInvalidEmail()`, `checkInvalidEmailFormatError()` vs `checkEmailValidationError()`
**Solution Applied**: Method name standardization using grep searches
**Result**: All method calls properly aligned between tests and POMs

### Challenge 3: Complex Inheritance Dependencies
**Issue**: Integration tests had complex interdependencies between POMs and base classes
**Specific Area**: auth_common_pom.dart serves as base class for multiple POMs
**Solution Applied**: Base class preservation with minimal changes
**Result**: Maintained inheritance hierarchy while achieving significant simplification

### Challenge 4: Balancing Simplification with Functionality
**Issue**: Removing code while maintaining all necessary functionality
**Specific Areas**: Determining which validation methods were essential vs redundant
**Solution Applied**: Creative phase planning for architectural decisions
**Result**: Clear guidance for implementation, reducing decision-making overhead

## Lessons Learned
